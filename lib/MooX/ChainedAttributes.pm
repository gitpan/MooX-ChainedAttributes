MooX::ChainedAttributes - Make your attributes chainable.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Foo;
    use Moo;
    use MooX::ChainedAttributes;
    
    has name => (
        is      => 'rw',
        chained => 1,
    );
    
    has age => (
        is => 'rw',
    );
    
    chain('age');
    
    sub who {
        my ($self) = @_;
        print "My name is " . $self->name() . "!\n";
    }
    
    my $foo = Foo->new();
    $foo->name('Fred')->who(); # My name is Fred!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Chaining is a questionable feature to support.  It leads to all kinds
of crazyness, all of which just cause developers pain.  It works with
some things like C<jQuery>, but typically it is to be avoided.

That being said, this module exists for your chaining enjoyment.  It
was developed in order to support the porting of
L<MooseX::Attribute::Chained> using classes to L<Moo>.

In L<Moose> you would write:

    package Bar;
    use Moose;
    use MooseX::Attribute::Chained;
    has baz => ( is=>'rw', traits=>['Chained'] );

To port the above to L<Moo> just change it to:

    package Bar;
    use Moo;
    use MooX::ChainedAttributes;
    has baz => ( is=>'rw', chained=>1 );
